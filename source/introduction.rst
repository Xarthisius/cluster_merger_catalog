Introduction
============

Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the current universe. Originally
identified as concentrations of galaxies in the optical, observations in the X-ray and millimeter
wavelengths have revealed the bulk of baryonic material of clusters is comprised of a hot, magnetized
plasma known as the intracluster medium (ICM). The kinetic energy of the galaxies and the temperature
of the hot gas indicate that in order for the cluster to be gravitationally bound the majority of the
mass must be in the form of cold dark matter (CDM).

Mergers between galaxy clusters represent the latest stage of cosmological structure formation. The most
energetic events in the universe, mergers drive shocks and turbulence into the ICM, accelerating relativistic
particles which then produce radio relics and halos. Cluster mergers have also revealed the different
dynamical properties of the CDM, galaxies, and ICM, seen most vividly in the case of the Bullet Cluster.
Understanding cluster mergers is therefore vital to answering questions about the detailed physics of
galaxy clusters as well as providing insights into the formation of cosmic structure.

The astrophysical literature is replete with simulations of galaxy cluster mergers, from binary merger
simulations to studies of mergers in cosmological simulations. These simulations have often attempted to
make predictions for what may be observed in a number of wavebands and made direct comparisons to
observed merging systems. However, comparing the results of simulations of cluster mergers to these
systems is often not straighforward; at what stage are we viewing the merger, and along what line of
sight? To make matters more complicated, different combinations of merger epoch and line of sight can
produce qualitatively similar projections of cluster emission, making it more difficult to determine
these parameters. 

The idea behind this catalog is to provide a way to connect simulations of galaxy cluster mergers
with multiwavelength observations of real merging clusters. Producing simulation data in terms of 
observed quantities at many different epochs and from many different lines of sight provides an
opportunity for observers to compare clusters in their observations with a particular merging
scenario. The data here may also be analyzed in its own right, to make predictions for what various
investigations of real clusters may reveal.
