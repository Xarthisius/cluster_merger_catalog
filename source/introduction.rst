Introduction
============

Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the current universe. Originally
identified as concentrations of galaxies in the optical, observations in the X-ray and millimeter
wavelengths have revealed the bulk of baryonic material of clusters is comprised of a hot, magnetized
plasma known as the intracluster medium (ICM, 
`Forman et al. 1972 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...178..309F>`_, 
`Sunyaev & Zel'dovich 1972 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972CoASP...4..173S>`_). The kinetic energy 
of the galaxies and the temperature of the hot gas indicate that in order for the cluster to be 
gravitationally bound the majority of the mass must be in the form of cold dark matter (CDM, first noted by 
`Zwicky 1937 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1937ApJ....86..217Z>`_).

Mergers between galaxy clusters represent the latest stage of cosmological structure formation. The most
energetic events in the universe, mergers drive shocks and turbulence into the ICM, heating and stirring 
the cluster gas. These mergers also accelerate relativistic particles, which then produce radio relics and 
halos (`Feretti 2005 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AdSpR..36..729F>`_, 
`Brunetti & Lazarian 2007 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.378..245B>`_, 
`van Weeren et al. 2010 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010Sci...330..347V>`_,
`Br√ºggen et al. 2011 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012SSRv..166..187B>`_). Cluster mergers have also
revealed the different dynamical properties of the CDM, galaxies, and ICM, seen most vividly in the case 
of the Bullet Cluster (`Clowe et al. 2004 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ApJ...604..596C>`_,
`Markevitch et al. 2004 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ApJ...606..819M>`_). Understanding cluster 
mergers is therefore vital to answering questions about the detailed physics of galaxy clusters as well 
as providing insights into the formation of cosmic structure.

The astrophysical literature is replete with simulations of galaxy cluster mergers, from binary merger
simulations (e.g., `Ricker & Sarazin 2001 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...561..621R>`_, 
`Poole et al. 2006 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.373..881P>`_, 
`Poole et al. 2007 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.380..437P>`_, 
`Poole et al. 2008 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.391.1163P>`_,
`ZuHone et al. 2010 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...717..908Z>`_,
`ZuHone 2011 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...728...54Z>`_) to studies of mergers in cosmological 
simulations. These simulations have often attempted to make predictions for what may be observed in a 
number of wavebands and made direct comparisons to observed merging systems. However, comparing the 
results of simulations of cluster mergers to these systems is often not straighforward; at what stage 
are we viewing the merger, and along what line of sight? To make matters more complicated, different 
combinations of merger epoch and line of sight can produce qualitatively similar projections of cluster 
emission, making it more difficult to determine these parameters. 

The idea behind this catalog is to provide a way to connect simulations of galaxy cluster mergers
with multiwavelength observations of real merging clusters. Producing simulation data in terms of 
observed quantities at many different epochs and from many different lines of sight provides an
opportunity for observers to compare clusters in their observations with a particular merging
scenario. The data here may also be analyzed in its own right, to make predictions for what various
investigations of real clusters may reveal.
