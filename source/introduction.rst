What is this?
-------------

Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the current universe. 

How can I use it?
-----------------

The idea behind this catalog is to provide a way to connect simulations of galaxy cluster mergers
with multiwavelength observations of real merging clusters. The latter are observed in various stages
of merging, and along various lines of sight with respect to the merger axis. Producing simulation
data in terms of observed quantities at many different epochs and from many different lines of sight
provides an opportunity for observers to match clusters in their observations with a particular merging
scenario. The data here may also be analyzed in its own right, to make predictions for what various
investigations of real clusters may reveal.
