Binary Cluster Merger Catalog
=============================

Welcome to the Binary Cluster Merger Catalog!

This catalog provides data from a number of simulations of galaxy cluster mergers. Specifically,
for each simulation you will find projections of simulated observable quantities related to galaxy
clusters at a various stages of a cluster merger. These synthetic observations span a number of
wavebands, from millimeter to X-ray. The goal is to provide both observers and theorists in the
area of galaxy clusters a resource for studying mergers and comparing simulated data to real
observations. The simulation data has been post-processed using `yt <http://yt-project.org>`_.

The catalog and its data is hosted on the `yt Hub <http://hub.yt>`_, provided by the
`Data Exploration Lab <https://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu/>`_ at the
`National Center for Supercomputing Applications <http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/>`_, at the
`University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign <http://www.illinois.edu>`_.
