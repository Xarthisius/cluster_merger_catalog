Why is background not included in the simulated X-ray event files?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Though the events have been simulated for a particular detector, *Chandra*'s ACIS-I, it 
seemed prudent to not include background events and instead let the end-user decide
what background to simulate, if any. For example, one could use background events from
the `*Chandra* ACIS blank-sky background files <http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/acisbackground/>`_. 

I have some really cool data I'd like to include in the catalog. How can I do this?

How do I cite the catalog?
