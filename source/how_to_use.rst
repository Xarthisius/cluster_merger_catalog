How to Use the Catalog
======================

This page provides a brief description of how to interact with and obtain the data in the
catalog. 

View the Simulation Evolution
-----------------------------

Clicking on a particular simulation's like will take you to a page which shows various quantities
projected along the z-axis for every epoch of the simulation that is available. Scrolling
up and down on this page will give you a sense of what the evolution looks like in these
quantities. You can click on a particular set of images to get you to the images and files
for a particular epoch. 

Examine the Images
------------------

Once you are at a particular epoch's page, you can look at the images for the various fields 
which will enlarge when clicked. 

Download the FITS Files
-----------------------

There are download links on every epoch page for downloading FITS files for slices, projections,
Sunyaev-Zeldovich projections, and X-ray event files. 

Choosing a Projection Direction
-------------------------------

For the projected fields, changing the projection axis on the drop-down menu will update
the images for the projected fields as well as the links to the FITS files.
