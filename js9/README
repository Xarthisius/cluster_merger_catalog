JS9 is our Web-based implementation of DS9, the de facto standard image display
for astronomy. With JS9, you can:

  - display FITS images and tables in a Web page
  - drag and drop FITS images and tables
  - retrieve FITS files from data archives
  - change the colormap and scale algorithm
  - blend images and apply RGB image filters
  - mouse move displays pixel values, WCS info
  - one finger displays pixel values, WCS info
  - mouse press/move changes the contrast/bias
  - two fingers changes the contrast/bias
  - create and manipulate regions of interest
  - extend JS9 using plugins and the public API
  - perform data analysis (local and server-side)
  - control JS9 from a command shell or Python
  - print images, save images, etc ...

The JS9 Website contains on-line documentation, demos, and downloads:

    http://js9.si.edu

Of course, JS9 also is available on GitHub:

For installation instructions, start with help/install.html

JS9 can change how we think about image display and analysis, moving
beyond the Desktop into the Web. You can simply drag and drop a FITS
image from your computer onto the JS9 display. All of basic JS9/DS9
functionality is immediately available: zoom, pan, colormaps, scaling,
regions, WCS, etc.

You can extend JS9 using the Plugin facility in combination with the
JS9 Public API. For example, you can perform browser-based analysis on
the displayed image. On the JS9 Website, click the Plugins tab, create
a region, and move it around ...

In addition, URL-based data files support server-side analysis (using
the original data files on the back-end server).  Server-side analysis
can be run, for example, in response to region changes, with the
results displayed back in your browser. On the JS9 Website, click the
Analysis tab, choose a task, create a region, and move it around ...

JS9 originally was conceived as way to provide DS9 functionality on
the Web, in order to support astronomical data archives, data centers,
and individual projects. It subsequently has proven its value in the 
lab, on education Web pages, and as part of Web-based analysis tools.
It has been tested on a variety of browsers (Firefox, Safari, Chrome, 
IE9) using a variety of operating systems (Linux, OS X, IOS, Windows).

We are very interested in exploring new uses for JS9 as we evolve its
functionality in response to community needs. If you would like to 
join the fun, please contact us at: saord@cfa.harvard.edu.
